    <p>I am a versatile and ambitious individual with a strong foundation in <em>Arts and Social Sciences
        Education.</em>
    <p>A guitarist with a passion for music, I am honing my craft with the goal of becoming
        one of the best session guitarists in America. I also have a keen interest in technology, learning <em>Python,
            Django, and Flask</em> to bring <a href="https://github.com/EbenTheGreat"><em>innovative ideas</em></a>
        to life.</p>
    <p>Previously,I dabbled in trading and entrepreneurship, running <a href="https://www.instagram.com/ryder_wave_kits?
    utm_source=ig_web_button_share_sheet&igsh=ZDNlZDc0MzIxNw=="><em>Ryder Wave Kits</em></a> in<em>2021</em>,
        a business focused on wave haircare products. Now, I am exploring opportunities to
        blend creativity and tech, such as building <em>Zion</em>, a Christian-focused app designed to help users grow
        in their faith.
        Based in Lagos, Nigeria, I have an entrepreneurial spirit and a love for learning.
        With plans to share music tips on my Instagram account, <em>'musicislife,'</em> and a desire to impact lives
        through tech and music, I am on a journey to leave a meaningful legacy.</p></td>
